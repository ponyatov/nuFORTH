# About FORTH

* [FORTH is the best for CLI and prototyping DML/DDL](https://ponyatov.quora.com/On-computer-language-design-FORTH-is-the-best-for-CLI-and-prototyping-DML-DDL)

## Forth programming language

* extra compact **primitive language without syntax** in fact
* it has no syntax parser: you need only primitive lexer to implement the whole of language
* it is **very easy and fast to rewrite** *your own* **FORTH implementation** from scratch
* it uses **concatenative programming** paradigm via shared data stack
* unbeatable as a **command shell interface with programming ability**
for tiny embedded systems starting from few Kb of RAM (cheapest microcontroller-based)
* can be good as DDL/DML/OML (object manipulation language) in a language-less programming systems

## How to start

To feel the language you should take these books:

### Thinking FORTH

If you want use it not only in command shell mode,
but also write more complex programs, you can red this
