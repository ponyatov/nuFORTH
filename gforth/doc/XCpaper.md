Subject: Re: MetaForth: A Forth extension to create Forth?

An effort in the direction of standardizing target compilers was started 
some time ago, by FORTH, Inc. and MPE (both of whom have written and 
maintained target compilers for many years).

This article covers some basic concepts:

Normative (required behavior) text is here:

Explanatory appendices are here:

Both companies have moved on since then, but many of the concepts are 
still valid and in use. For an illustrationn, you might want to take a 
look at one of the free trial versions of SwiftX:
